# 42 School Projects

This repository contains my projects from the 42 School curriculum, including **Piscine** and **Libft** projects. All projects are implemented in **C** and are part of my learning journey in programming and software development.

## Projects

### 1. Piscine Projects
- Projects completed during the 42 Piscine intensive training.
- Focused on core C programming concepts, algorithms, and problem-solving exercises.

### 2. Libft
- The Libft project involves creating a custom C library of functions commonly used in programming.
- Reinforces understanding of pointers, memory management, and C standard library functions.

## Installation
```bash
git clone https://github.com/username/repo.git
cd repo
# Navigate to each project folder to compile and run the C programs
